# Universal Repository Template

This is my default repository template for all the new projects I start.  
It includes my basic license and GitHub config files.

## Usage

You're free to use this template for your projects as well! I would love to see the values that this template encourages and holds within to be spread around the world. The only thing that is unique to me is the account name in [FUNDING](.github/FUNDING.yml) and my name in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
